# HTML-AgeChecker
A straightforward component built with HTML that showcases a fundamental understanding of HTML functions.

This Age Checker component evaluates the numerical age entered into the input field and compares it against a simple if-else statement with the following criteria:

- If the age is less than 16, the first result is displayed.
- If the age is 16 or 17, the second result is displayed.
- If the age is greater than 17, the third result is displayed.
The webpage incorporates various elements, including:

Text elements such as the title and subtitle
- An input field that exclusively accepts whole numbers
- A button that triggers an event upon being clicked
- A text field that generates results based on the input age, with the results displayed in different colors depending on the outcome.
